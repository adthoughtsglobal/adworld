  1. Community Engagement: High-scoring individuals could be encouraged to participate in community projects and initiatives, where their expertise and leadership can benefit the community as a whole.
  
  1. Educational Support: High-scoring individuals might receive educational support in the form of mentorship programs or access to additional learning resources, without compromising equal educational opportunities for all.
